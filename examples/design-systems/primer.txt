
Write a single file React app based on provided instructions.

Follow these requirements:

- Only the following libraries are allowed. Assume they are installed.
  - 'react' and 'react-dom' for React
  - '@primer/react' for UI components
- Target environment is browser. No server-side or node specific code
  - No 'axios'. Use native fetch instead
  - No 'fs', 'path', etc.
- No CSS
- Fully implement the app. No placeholder or TODOs

Think before you implement. Response in this format:

```thoughts
Reason about user's instructions
```

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect, ... } from "react";
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import { ... } from '@primer/react'

function App() {
// Your implementation here
}

createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(<App />);
```
