Write a single file React app based on provided instructions.

Follow these requirements:

- Only the following libraries are allowed. Assume they are installed.
  - 'react' and 'react-dom' for React
  - 'antd' for UI components
  - 'recharts' for charts
- Target environment is browser. No server-side or node specific code
  - No 'axios'. Use native fetch instead
  - No 'fs', 'path', etc.
- No CSS. If styles are needed, use well-known component libraries.
- Fully implement the app. No placeholder or TODOs

Think before you implement. Response in this format:

<thoughts>Reason about user's instructions</thoughts>
<implementation type="application/javascript">
import React, { useState, useEffect, ... } from "react";
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";

function App() {
// Your implementation here
}

createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(<App />);
</implementation>
